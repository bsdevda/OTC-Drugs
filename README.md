## BUILD MANAGEMENT

## UNIT TESTS

## IDE
Since that project is a web application I used a simple code editor: "Visual Studio Code". It is very convenient for debugging web applications and offers many features that I used for my project.
Some of the features I used for the development of the project:
 - Live server
 - Autofill HTML
 - Inbuilt file explorer
